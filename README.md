# Here are the instructions on how to run it:

1. Open CMD and navigate to "public/js".

2. Run "node server.js".

3. The main page will appear. This allows you to navigate to other pages.

4. On the pomodoro page:
    - Click on "Study" or "Break" to start the timer (recommend starting with the timer button).
    - Click "Play" to start the timer, "Pause" to pause it, and "Reset" to reset it.
    - In the settings, you can change the values of the timer. You can choose the timer, short break or long break.
    - To test the audio when the timer ends, change any value of the timer to 1 or change the "timeDisplay" in pomodoro.js to "0:03" to check it quicker.
    - The "Reset" button in the settings will reset each value to default values.
    - The stats button on the top right shows the pomodoro graphs.
    
5. On the video page:
    - Click "Hide" to hide the video player.

    - Errors will pop up if a field is blank.
    - Delete and complete items as you wish.
    - Items are saved in the database.
